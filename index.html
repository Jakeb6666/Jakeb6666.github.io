            <p>
            Hey! I'm Jake Brown, 29 years old, I live in the East Midlands, England, United Kingdom.
            I work as a car salesman for a company called Available Car Ltd, we sell a huge variety
            of used cars of all brands and I have worked there for almost 2 years.<br><br>
            I have always wanted to be a full-stack engineer and work with web development,
            ever since I was in college. This course has given me a goal to look forward to,
            a new skill I have always wanted to learn, and hopefully an amazing career to be a part of.<br><br>
            I have a son named Adam who is 12.<br><br>
            In my free time, I love to hang out with friends, do some coding (obviously) and spend time with my partner and kids.<br><br>
            Fun fact about me is, I own a beautiful French Bulldog and even a few Tarantulas!
            </p>
