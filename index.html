            <p>
            Hello, my name is Jake, I have been learning to code now since November 2023. It has always been a dream of mine to become a website developer
                and watch as my creations are shared by millions. I am loving the journey from not knowing what a server was to now being able to build
                static HTML pages, responsive websites and even include some JavaScript for interactivity.<br><br>

                I live in the United Kingdom, East Midlands and I have an amazing supportive network around me of family and friends.<br><br> 
                
                My job at the moment is a Sales Executive in the motor industry, selling used cars of all brands for a very well known company, Available Car.<br><br>

                This website is the start of showing people what I can do just a few months into studying to be a Full-Stack Engineer. As time goes by and the more I learn,
                I will be able to put more into my Portfolio and make this site now, into something great.

                I have included below examples of other projects I have done, if you would like to give me feedback or show me your projects,
                you can do in the Contact Me! Section of this website.
